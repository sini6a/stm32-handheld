![screenshot #1](images/stopwatchy-kicad.png)

The STM32 Pocket Game/Dev Console is a handheld device powered by 2xAAA batteries. This compact console features 5 programmable buttons, 2 LEDs, and an SPI TFT 2.4" display with a resolution of 320x240 pixels.

Originally equipped with a TagConnect connector for programming, the board underwent a redesign, now featuring a basic 2.54mm pitch connector for enhanced programming flexibility.

Measuring only 97x70mm, this board is designed to be easily customized for various purposes according to your specific needs.

## Key Features:

- Powered by 2xAAA batteries for portability.
- 5 programmable input buttons for versatile interaction.
- 2 LEDs for status indication.
- Battery voltage monitoring through analog readings.
- 2.4" SPI TFT display with a resolution of 320x240 pixels.
- 2.54mm pitch connector for programming convenience.
